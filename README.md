## What is MDDLib
MDDLib is a library to create and manipulate Multi-valud Decision Diagrams, written in **Java 11**.  
MDDLib is designed to be able to run without a garbage collector : `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseEpsilonGC` in JVM Options.  
This library is a work in progress. As such, we do not guarantee any forward compatibility.

## Documentation, Support and Issues

## Tools

### MDDViewer
This allows you to visualise a .dot file on your browser, without having to install anything. This was made using the [viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js) library under MIT License.  
MDDLib is able to generate MDDs under .dot format. More information here : [MDD2Dot](https://jungvictor.github.io/#/mdd2dot).


## Planned
- Adding support for pure Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs).
- Adding support for non-deterministic MDDs.
